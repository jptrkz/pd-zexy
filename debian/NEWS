pd-zexy (2.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  runtime components installed into /usr/lib/pd/extra/zexy

  in order to prevent namespace pollution (and in sync with upstream), all
  runtime components of zexy (binary + abstractions) are now installed into
  /usr/lib/pd/extra/zexy.
  if you want to use the zexy abstractions, you will have to add this to Pd's
  search path (see README.Debian)
