pd-zexy for Debian
-------------------

these are general instructions to load the zexy library, not specific to Debian.

Usage:

zexy consists of both a (binary) library and a set of abstractions.
Therefore, if you want to access all of the zexy objects, you need to tell Pd to
both 

- load the library (either by adding "zexy" to the list of startup libraries in
  Pd's preferences, or by using the "-lib zexy" commandline argument to Pd)

and to

- add the search-path for the abstractions (either by adding
  "/usr/lib/pd/extra/zexy" to the paths in Pd's preferences of by using the
  "-path /usr/lib/pd/extra/zexy" commandlind argument to Pd)


step-by-step:

 METHOD 1:
 start Pd
 - navigate to "File->Path..." and add "/usr/lib/pd/extra/zexy" to the list of search-paths
 - click OK
 - navigate to "File->Startup..." and add "zexy" to the list of binaries to be loaded
 - click "Apply" and "Save all settings"


 METHOD 2:
 issue the command (without the '%' sign)
 % pd -path /usr/lib/pd/extra/zexy -lib zexy
